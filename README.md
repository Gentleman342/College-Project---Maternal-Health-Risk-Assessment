# College-Project---Maternal-Health-Risk-Assessment
"Maternal Health Risk Assessment" is a project where I used a machine learning model to predict the risk levels of pregnant women as high, mid, or low. Among various algorithms tested, the Random Forest algorithm achieved the best accuracy at 86.69%. I deployed this model on a website using Flask, making it accessible for healthcare providers to assess maternal health risks efficiently.
