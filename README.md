# College-Project---Maternal-Health-Risk-Assessment
My last project was a college project and it was a 4 student group, out of which 99% of the work was done by me. The title of the project was Maternal Health Risk Assessment and it was a machine learning project where our model predicted the risk level of the pregnant women as high, mid and low risk with an accuracy of 86.69 %. The best algorithm was Random Forest Classifier which we implemented well and with that we also created a interactive website and implemented our model on that website with the help of flask framework.
